# Introduction

The purpose of this project is to develop a simple FSM that can determine the divisibility of a ternary number by 5. The FSM takes advantage of the relationship between remainders and divisibility to efficiently make this determination. The report discusses the design, implementation, and usage of the FSM.




Background and Objectives
This project involves designing and implementing a Finite State Machine (FSM) to determine the divisibility of a ternary number by 5. The objectives are to provide a practical illustration of FSMs in digital systems and demonstrate their role in solving arithmetic problems.

Role of FSMs in Digital Systems
FSMs are crucial components in digital systems, controlling various functions based on inputs and current states. Their applications range from controlling complex systems to solving mathematical problems efficiently in hardware.







Transistor-level design connects transistors into circuits to build gates or other components. Combinational or sequential circuits whose building blocks are primarily logic gates are thus called logic-level design. Designing circuits whose building blocks are registers and other datapath components consists of transferring data from registers through other datapath components like adders and back to registers. Such design is thus called register-transfer level design or RTL design.
